My goal was to look at for trends in Tesla's stock vloume. I chose stock volume as my target as metrics like stock price are more of a zero sum game. I was able to simple download my stock data in a csv file from a simple google search. The same was the case for Elon Musk's past twitter feed. To get the sec filling data I scrapped 4 pages of the website.
